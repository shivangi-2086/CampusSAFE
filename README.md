# 🛡️ CampusSAFE

**Preventive safety for women on campus**

CampusSAFE is a campus-focused safety and awareness platform designed for women students.  
It focuses on **prevention, early reporting, and awareness**, not just emergency response.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Many women on college campuses experience:
- Being stared at or followed
- Verbal harassment
- Unsafe or poorly lit paths
- Discomfort that doesn’t feel like an “emergency”

Most safety apps only work **after** something serious happens.

---

## 💡 The Solution

CampusSAFE helps women:
- Report discomfort early
- Mark unsafe zones on campus
- Get awareness alerts before situations escalate
- Feel safer during daily movement (hostels, classes, libraries)

It bridges the gap between **discomfort** and **emergency**.
